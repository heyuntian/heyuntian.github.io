This is the final project for the course CSE 5525 (Speech and Language Processing) at OSU. The code is available at [here][https://github.com/heyuntian/CSE5525-Course-Project]. 

This project uses the [Movie][https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset] dataset from Kaggle, which contains 26 million ratings from 270,000 users for all 45,000 movies. Ratings are on a scale of 0.5-5 and have been obtained from the official GroupLens website.

We proposed a hybrid filtering recommendation system which leverage the text corpus, rating relationship, and movie attributes in the dataset. Specifically, we build a heterogeneous information network (HIN) to learn the representations of objects of different types. For each movie, we also learn additional representations from its related text data. The learned embeddings are used to train a classifier to predict a user's rating on a given movie.
